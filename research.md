**SNAP Work Requirement and Food Insecurity**

  <p style="color:rgb(44, 62, 80)" align="justify"> 
In this paper, I examine the effect of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program
			(SNAP) work requirement reinstatement on food insecurity outcomes of able-bodied
			adults without dependents (ABAWDs). The policy restricts SNAP benefits of ABAWDs
			to 3 months in a 36 months period if they are not working or participating in any work
			program for at least 20 hours a week. In the aftermath of 2008 recession, the American 
			Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 waived work requirements nationwide, and
			many states reimplemented the work rule at different times beginning in 2011. I employ
			a difference-in-differences approach utilizing this cross-state variation in reimplementation 
			of the policy. Using rich information on food affordability and food intake behavior
			from the Food Security Supplement of the Current Population Survey (CPS-FSS), I
			find that promoting work for food assistance improved overall food security status of
			ABAWDs by reducing disruptions in food intake, anxiety over food affordability and
			dependency on emergency food receipt. Subsample analyses indicate that effects are
			stronger for never married and less educated ABAWDs.
