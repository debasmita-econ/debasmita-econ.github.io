**SNAP Work Requirement and Food Insecurity**

  <p style="color:rgb(44, 62, 80)" align="justify"> 
In this paper, I examine the effect of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program
			(SNAP) work requirement reinstatement on food insecurity outcomes of able-bodied
			adults without dependents (ABAWDs). The policy restricts SNAP benefits of ABAWDs
			to 3 months in a 36 months period if they are not working or participating in any work
			program for at least 20 hours a week. In the aftermath of 2008 recession, the American 
			Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 waived work requirements nationwide, and
			many states reimplemented the work rule at different times beginning in 2011. I employ
			a difference-in-differences approach utilizing this cross-state variation in reimplementation 
			of the policy. Using rich information on food affordability and food intake behavior
			from the Food Security Supplement of the Current Population Survey (CPS-FSS), I
			find that promoting work for food assistance improved overall food security status of
			ABAWDs by reducing disruptions in food intake, anxiety over food affordability and
			dependency on emergency food receipt. Subsample analyses indicate that effects are
			stronger for never married and less educated ABAWDs.

**Cohort-specific Pension Reform and Married Couple's Labor Supply**

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  <p style="color:rgb(44, 62, 80)" align="justify">
	Retirement decisions of married couples are often jointly planned. In this paper, I study how retirement behavior of married couples 
	respond to cohort-specific Social Security policy reform that introduced actuarial deductions for early retirement in combination with 
	an increase in the Full Retirement Age (FRA), that is the age from which an individual may claim a non-reduced Social Security retirement 
	benefit. I develop a rich dynamic structural model of older married couples’ savings, labor force participation and Social Security benefit 
	claim decisions over the lifecycle, and explore how the policy reform affect financial incentive of married couples’ retirement timing decisions. 
	I calibrate the model using Method of Simulated Moments applied to the data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), and simulate life-cycle 
	behavior of married couples under the specific benefit regime they face. I use the estimated model to perform a policy experiment to simulate 
	couples’ labor supply behavior if the reform increases FRA of men but keeps FRA of women unchanged at the pre-reform level.

  In India, rising demand for gold had an adverse impact on the country's current account balance and the attempts to curb gold import demand often failed 
	in the recent past. In this paper, we empirically investigate the reasons of such failures by analyzing the possibility of habit formation and 
	inventory adjustment effects in determining the dynamics of gold import demand in India. Using three dynamic demand models based on distributed 
	lag specifications, we estimate the price and income elasticities of different forms of physical gold imports, viz. non-monetary powder 
	form of gold, other non-monetary semi-manufactured forms of gold and other non-monetary unwrought forms of gold. Based on monthly gold 
	import data, we find that Indian consumers care about variation in gold prices, silver prices, gold import expenditures and long-term bond yield in 
	the short-run, but in the longer horizon they exhibit demand persistence. Different sensitivity of different forms of gold import suggest that 
	an aggregate demand analysis fails to capture the non-symmetric mechanisms operating on different components of gold import demand in India.

	In this study, we provide a holistic working definition of inclusive growth unlike previous definitions that come under the shadow 
	of pro-poor growth or inequality reduction. We measure inclusive growth through a newly proposed index, named as the Inclusive Growth 
	Index (IGI), based on 24 developmental indicator variables (categorized into expansion, sustainability, equity in access, and efficiency 
	of economic activities and institutions) as its components. We have employed two kinds of weighting schemes in constructing the index: 
	an ad hoc weighting scheme and a weighting scheme based on principal component analysis (PCA), performed differently on variables under 
	each dimension. We calculated IGI for 16 Asian countries and we ranked the countries according to their respective inclusive growth achievements.
	Through a comparison of IGI values with the Human Development Index (HDI) values, our findings give insight to the fact that how HDI values can 
	be misleading in measuring development performance of a country and how IGI is able to identify income based as well as non-income based 
	aspects of well-being.
