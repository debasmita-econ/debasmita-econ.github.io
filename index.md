<!--  My name is Debasmita Das. -->
I am a PhD candidate in the [Department of Economics](https://krannert.purdue.edu/academics/economics/) at [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/).
<!-- , where I'm advised by Victoria Prowse, Trevor Gallen and Kevin Mumford -->

**Research Field:** Labor Economics, Public Economics and Applied Microeconomics

<!-- Add JMP -->

My research combines data, theory, econometrics, and computer programming to study mechanisms behind household decision-making. I am interested in understanding how social insurance policies shape important life outcomes. My research relies on tools from applied econometrics, numerical computational methods, quasi-experimental and causal inference methods.

<!-- Methodologically, I conduct economic analyses using tools from applied econometrics, numerical computational methods, quasi-experimental and causal inference methods. -->

I am on the job market in the 2021-2022 season. Please feel free to reach out if you think I would be a good fit for your academic department or industry research group.
